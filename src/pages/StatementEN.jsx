          Statement regarding the video “What Happened?” by Tobias
          Riemenschneider, in which he publicly presents his account of
          the events surrounding his removal from office and excommunication.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a congregation, with a clear conscience, we have done what we
          recognized before God, our holy LORD, to be necessary and required.
          We fear Him more than men. However, we are not willing to engage in
          a public mudslinging campaign or to quarrel before the eyes of the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will endure all the false and evil things now being alleged against us,
          without publicly defending or justifying ourselves. We believe that it is
          good and beneficial for us to be humbled. Our God opposes the proud,
          but gives grace to the humble.
        </p>

        <p>
          We expressly distance ourselves from all other public statements or
          comments on this matter and do not adopt their content as our own.
          At the same time, we also ask everyone else to refrain from disputes
          on the internet.
        </p>

        <p>
          We sincerely thank you for all intercession and care, and we trust
          solely in the eternal cornerstone of the church—our faithful Lord
          Jesus Christ.
        </p>

          “Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come,
          who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness,
          and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts:
          and then shall every man have praise of God.”
          (1 Corinthians 4:5)
